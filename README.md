# OCR digits using MNIST

This project solves the MNIST digits dataset, to solve the kaggle problem:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/overview

Three solutions are used:
1) Self-programmed neural network. File: **OCR_MNIST_NN_SELFPROGRAMMED.ipynb**
2) Tensorflow convnet. File: **OCR_MNIST_TENSORFLOW.ipynb**
3) Tensorflow transfer learning from DenseNet121. File: **OCR_MNIST TENSORFLOW_TRANSFER LEARNING.ipynb**

Solutions 2) and 3) include data augmentation using Tensorflow.

All solutions are given in Jupyter notebook format.
